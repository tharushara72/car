            Enables smooth terminal visits for transport coordinators and truck drivers. Preparing a visit with 
user interface is easy: drivers reserve an available time slot and enter vehicle, and container details. After the
terminal visit has been prepared, customer-specific logic and validations are executed at the gate area to allow
access to and from the terminal area. On the premises, the booking information is compared with real-time
identification data captured by the terminal gate operating system.

<p>    Gives terminal operators insights and possibilities for reviewing current and upcoming traffic events and
    truck appointments, while also providing extensive management tools for operational planning. Functionalities
    of VBS are customizable to ensure a good match with customer preferences and requirements. VBS can be seamlessly integrated to a terminalâ€™s existing system base, including Gate Operating System (GOS), Terminal Operating
    System (TOS), and self-service kiosks. VBS ensures smooth data exchange and well-functioning transactions in every stage of a visit.
